# taf-checker-4-vba
Aviation forecast QC tool

Inherited as version 2.7 and slowly rebuilt from the ground up as I learned how to program, TAF Checker has become an absolute monster.  The code isn't pretty and some legacy items probably still linger, squirreled away in places I haven't explored yet, but I've done my best to make it a more quality product that does what it needs to and maybe a few extra things on the side.  It's been of immense value to me and my coworkers, and hopefully (if you intend to use it) to you as well.

TAF Checker 4 VBA (like all other versions of TC4, or TCX, at least the ones I've made) is licensed under the Unlicense, so feel free to use it as you see fit.
